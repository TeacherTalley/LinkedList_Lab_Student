### <p style="text-align: center;">Data Structures CSCI 2320

#### Lab Objective
Learn how to implement and use a LinkedList ADT in C++.

#### Lab Overview
You will receive a partial implementation of a LinkedList in C++.  Your mission is to implement some of the methods for the class as well as understand all the other methods.

#### Lab Tasks

**Task 1**

Implement the following methods for the LinkedList class in **`LinkedList.h`**:
- **`void insert(int index, const T& value)`** This method inserts an item in the list at the specified index, which starts at zero.  This method should throw an **`out_of_range`** exception.
- **`void push_back(const T& value)`** This method places an item at the back of the list. 
- **`void push_front(const T& value)`** This method places an item at the front of the list. 
- **`void pop_back()`** This method removes the last item in the list. This method should throw an **`out_of_range`** exception.  
- **`void pop_front()`** This method removes the first item in the list. This method should throw an **`out_of_range`** exception.

**Task 2**

Implement the following in your main driver **`main.cpp`**.
- Print this exact message at the beginning of your main before any output.
**`Welcome to the LinkedList test program.`**

- Print this exact message at the end of your main after all other output.
**`Goodbye!`**

#### Final output
Your output must be ***exactly*** the following to receive the points allocated for output. 
```
Welcome to the LinkedList test program.

Test some integer lists...
Integer list 1: 5 10 20 30
Front element: 5
Back element: 30
Pop front: 5
Integer list 1: 10 20 30
Pop front: 10
Integer list 1: 20 30
Length of list 1 is 2
List 1 is not empty
Pop back: 30
Pop back: 20
Integer list 1::
List 1 is empty
Integer list 1: 10 20 30
Copy integer list 1 to integer list 2.
Integer list 2: 10 20 30
Pop 2 elements of the front of integer list 2.
Integer list 1:30:
Integer list 2:10 20 30:
Integer list 2 via std cout: 10 20 30:

Test some exceptions...
List 1 is empty
Front element: Exception: LinkedList is empty
Back element: Exception: LinkedList is empty

Test some string lists...
String list 1: Please, may I have some spam?

Try inserting an element at position 3
String list 1 has length 4
String list 1: Please, may I have some more spam?

Try inserting an element at the beginning
String list 1: Sir!  Sir!  Please, may I have some more spam?

Try inserting an element at the end
String list 1: Sir!  Sir!  Please, may I have some more spam? I love spam!

Try inserting an element out of range
String list 1 has length 7
Exception: Index out of range
Expected failure trying to insert out of range

Remove the first and last element and print result
String list 1: Please, may I have some more spam?

Goodbye!

```
